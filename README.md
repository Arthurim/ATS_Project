# ATS_Project

Project realized in the context of the Applied Time Series course of the MAster 203.

## Motivation
Some financial products prices might move together because they are linked. For example if the price of crude oil rises then it is going to cost more to refine it and the price of gasoline will also go up. Therefore the spread between the two can be thought of being stationary, moving around a defined mean. However it happens that the spread moves away from the mean, this is when there are trading opportunities as the spread will mean revert. If the spread is far above its long term mean we can short it and if far below, buy it.

A Report explaining the methodology followed as well as the results can be found in the repo.
